# Overiew
Simple Python implementation of Conway's game of Life using Tkinter for GUI

**Left click on the cell** - changes state of a cell 

**Next step** — creates and renders next iteration of a board  

**Randomize** — creates and renders board randomly filled with dead and alive cells  

**Simulate** — creates next iteration of a board every 100 ms  

**Clear** — clears the board  

**Stop** —  stops the simulation

# Installation 
To run you need to simply clone repo, and run in a directory using terminal:
```
python3 main.py
```

## To-Do

- [ ] Implement minor features (ex. create custom cell states through GUI, save/load state of a board)
- [x] Make initial window size and canvas size depend on a user's screen size
- [x] Refactor code (its too messy rn)
